				<p>
					I absolutely love the creative arts. Music is by far my most favorite, however I'm not that good at it. I used to be in drama club when I was in high school, and I've done visual arts my entire life, though most of the time I drew pictures. When I got older, I was in a dance group called Venmark. In middle school, I started coming up with story ideas and writing them down. I also played the trumpet in concert band and jazz band in middle school and even high school, although it was hard for me to improve due to anxiety.
				</p>
				<p>
					Due to a circumstance, I started playing video games in middle school. As I grew up, I juggled between thoughts about what I wanted to do for my career. At one point, I wanted to be an author, another time a film director, and another time a video game developer. Since I loved playing video games and I loved creating things, I figured I would be a video game developer, and I could always come up with a storyline for the game as well. So I went to college to learn game development.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the first classes I ever took for game development was basic coding, and we did that in html, css, and javascript! That's when I discoverd my love for coding. As we were making basic web games, I wanted to learn more about website building. However, my professor wasn't that advanced in it. As a result, I started watching videos on YouTube on how to code a website, but most of them either just told you to "type this" or went too fast for me to understand what was happening instead of taking the time to explain what it was that they were doing. Eventually, I got my own domain name, DirewolfConnect, but still didn't have everything sink in. I eventually decided I wanted to go to a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp, and that's exactly what I did.
				</p>
				<p>
					I cannot wait to be a professional full stack web developer!
